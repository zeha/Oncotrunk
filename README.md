# Oncotrunk

PubSub based file syncing daemon.

Caveats:

- Requires unison to do the actual work.
- Requires a jabber account on a server with a pubsub server.
- Linux and OS X only until somebody implements Oncotrunk::Watchers::... for further platforms.
- Requires a server to sync to (say, public reachable ssh server). May also require unison there.

## Installation

Install globally:

    $ gem install oncotrunk

Install unison:

Debian/Ubuntu:

    $ apt-get install unison

OS X:

    $ brew install unison

## Usage

Start once to create a configfile:

    $ oncotrunk start
    A new config file has been created for you in /home/ch/.config/Oncotrunk/settings.yml. Please edit and restart.

Edit the mentioned file.

Start again:

    $ screen oncotrunk start

Oncotrunk will now register itself as a PubSub publisher and subscriber, and watch the local directory for changes.
You should now install Oncotrunk on a second machine (say, your laptop or the remote server) as well.
